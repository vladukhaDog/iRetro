## vladukha changes:
Removed sounds of wheel clicking, edited some configurations, added haptic feedback to the wheel, did a few little fixes like playPause double calling when viewing currently playing song but most important to me - added volume slider (yeah yeah i know, its not how it worked on ipod but i dont care).

## What is iRetro?
iRetro is a music app built for SwiftUIJam 2021 that reminds you of the past while building your future with the power of music.  

## Why we built it
We built iRetro to bring back nostalgia while empowering people with music.

## Challenges faced
The first major challenge was to establish the classic click wheel of the iPod Classic.  The second challenge was to read music from the user's library.  Each challenge was difficult, but with research and perseverance, we solved the challenges.

## The future
We plan to release iRetro to the App Store and empower people with music and nostalgia.

## Thank you
Just want to say thank you to SwiftUIJam for hosting this jam and offering the opportunity to have such a fun and learning filled weekend!
